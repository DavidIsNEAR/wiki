<h1> How Can I Start a Guild? </h1>

**Step one:**

Ensure that you have browsed through our directory of guilds to check if you can contribute to an already existing guild [https://near.org/guilds/](https://near.org/guilds/).

If you have general questions about Guilds or you want to know what a Guild Leader is, what to expect as a representative of your Community?! reach out to us here:[ https://nearverse.typeform.com/to/vs6blz9z](https://nearverse.typeform.com/to/vs6blz9z). 

**Step two:**

Once you’ve filled out the form, the Guilds Team will schedule a 1 on 1 call with you. We will be there to answer any further questions you might have about the ecosystem and provide all the available resources. We will also support you to refine your proposal/roadmap on the Governance Forum before moving onto the next stage. 

After receiving an overview about your prospective guild plans and needs, the guilds team will be able to guide you in a more specific way depending on your general guild theme (geographical/ creative/ marketing focused guild etc). It’s always a good idea to get connected with guilds/contributors with a similar passion. You can make a post in the forum to get feedback from the community and find interested candidates to potentially help your cause.  

**Step Three:**

[-Consider all of the legal aspects](https://nearlegal.com/ows_risk-assessment-recommendations/), who will be liable for receiving funds etc. 

-Sign up for Github/Telegram, add links (website, social, logo and general information + contact information).

-Create your DAO/Community.

-Create your announcement post on the forum; [here’s a template](https://gov.near.org/t/template-guild-introduction-post/3450) to follow. 

**Step Four:**

-Monthly syncs with the guild team; depending on the route taken to create your guild, you may or may not have entered our CRM system during your onboarding. If you entered and requested a call with the Guilds team, they will automatically add a regular monthly sync to your calendar.

-A member of our Operations team will reach out to you on telegram to get you added to the relevant communication channels. 

-Be sure to attend Bi-weekly office hours in order to receive the latest updates from the Guilds Team.
